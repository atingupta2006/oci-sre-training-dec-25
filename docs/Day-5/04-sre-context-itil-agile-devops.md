# Day 5: SRE in the Context of ITIL, Agile, DevOps

### Audience Context: IT Engineers and Developers

---

## 0. Deployment Assumptions

For this topic, we discuss how SRE relates to other frameworks and methodologies.

**Assumed Context:**
* **Organizations** may use ITIL, Agile, DevOps, or SRE
* **Understanding relationships** helps integration
* **Frameworks can complement** each other

---

## 1. Concept Overview

SRE doesn't replace ITIL, Agile, or DevOps—it complements them. Understanding how SRE relates to these frameworks helps organizations integrate SRE practices effectively.

## 2. SRE vs ITIL

**ITIL (Information Technology Infrastructure Library):**
* Focus: IT service management, processes, best practices
* Approach: Process-driven, documentation-heavy
* Scope: Broader IT operations

**SRE:**
* Focus: Reliability engineering, measurement, automation
* Approach: Engineering-driven, metrics-based
* Scope: Production reliability

**Integration:**
* SRE provides engineering rigor to ITIL processes
* ITIL processes support SRE practices
* Both focus on service reliability

---

## 3. SRE vs Agile

**Agile:**
* Focus: Iterative development, customer collaboration
* Approach: Sprints, user stories, rapid delivery
* Scope: Software development

**SRE:**
* Focus: Production reliability, measurement
* Approach: SLIs/SLOs, error budgets, automation
* Scope: Production operations

**Integration:**
* Agile delivers features, SRE ensures reliability
* Error budgets guide Agile velocity
* SRE feedback informs Agile priorities

---

## 4. SRE vs DevOps

**DevOps:**
* Focus: Collaboration, CI/CD, faster delivery
* Approach: Cultural movement, shared ownership
* Scope: Development and operations collaboration

**SRE:**
* Focus: Reliability engineering, measurement
* Approach: Engineering discipline, SLIs/SLOs
* Scope: Reliability and observability

**Integration:**
* DevOps enables delivery, SRE ensures reliability
* SRE practices enhance DevOps pipelines
* Both emphasize automation and collaboration

---

## 5. Integration Patterns

**DevOps + SRE:**
* DevOps builds pipelines, SRE adds reliability gates
* DevOps delivers features, SRE manages error budgets
* Shared ownership of reliability

**Agile + SRE:**
* Agile sprints include reliability work
* Error budgets influence sprint planning
* Production feedback informs backlogs

**ITIL + SRE:**
* ITIL processes, SRE measurement
* ITIL change management, SRE reliability validation
* ITIL incident management, SRE postmortems

---

## 6. Additional Notes

* Frameworks complement each other
* Integration is key to success
* Choose practices that fit your organization
* This topic helps understand SRE in broader context
